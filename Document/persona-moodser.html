However, most of her day is spent dealing with frustrated customers and trying to resolve their issues.

    <h2>Frustration and Needs</h2>
        <p>
            Her job is stressful and de-motivational, as she often deals with angry or difficult people. This job can also be emotionally draining, and she finds herself needing a mood boost throughout the day. She would need easy access to funny and sarcastic content that can provide that mood boost, even when dealing with difficult customers.
