<h3><strong>NAME:Gordon Gordy</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Profession</strong></h3>
    <p>
        they are a content creator on Tik Tok they fully understand the interface and video making capabilities of the app. They also use Instagram although are not as deeply invested or followed as on Tik Tok.
    </p>
<h3><strong>Tech skills</strong></h3>
    <p>
    They use apple products avidly for the ease of UI. Specifically the newest Mac, iphone 13, and Ipad  models. They prefer Safari or Chrome browsers when they need to search for tools and apps on the internet. They always keep their devices updated to have the fastest usage out of them. Otherwise they use a roku on their TV and have a plethora smart home appliances
    </p>
<h3><strong>Attitudes/Behaviors</strong></h3>
    <p>
    They check their feeds from the multiple apps they use for social media daily to gather information on the trends happening on their preferred apps. They use this information to form a plan for their content on Tik Tok. When a new application or tool for making memes or interesting content comes their way they will make an attempt to add that tool to their content.
    </p>
<h3><strong>Frustrations/Needs</strong></h3>
    <p>
    They are frustrated by a poorly implemented UI. While they do not code or make apps they also are user on many apps and have become quite accustomed to higher quality UI. They are frustrated when an app or tool they are trying to use is difficult to merge with their content. They will still go out of their way to make it work but if it is far too difficult they may move on due to the time constraints of the social trends they are attempting to capitalize on.
