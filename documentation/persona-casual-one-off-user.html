<h1>Persona: Casual User</h1>
<p>
    <strong>NAME: </strong>Sara
</p>
<p>
    <strong>AGE: </strong>34
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PROFESSION: </strong>Front desk receptionist in a dentist's office.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>TECHNOLOGY: </strong>She only uses a desktop computer at the office to manage patient scheduling and for miscellaneous office tasks. She doesn’t know much about tech and would generally ask her husband or office staff for help when she needs help with technology.  She uses an Android phone for personal calls, texting, and occasionally checking her social media accounts.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS: </strong>She has a family and kids at home and doesn’t have much time to be on tech outside of work. She just works on her 9-5 job and has few hobbies. She isn’t very creative in making things but likes to watch comedy shows and see incredible things that others do.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>FRUSTRATIONS AND NEEDS:  </strong> Time at the office can get boring doing the same things every day, dealing with patient scheduling and arriving in the office. She wants an escape from work while at the office and sometimes checks her Facebook account to see what her family and friends are up to. She doesn’t have time to do that at home, so she uses breaks at work or when not much is happening to log on to Facebook and browse her newsfeed. She doesn’t like political posts and always loves to see funny things that people share.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>GOALS:  </strong>Browses social media to escape from work and enjoys funny content that her friends and family share.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>USER STORY:  </strong>I often get bored at work and go to Facebook when I have free time to read funny posts by my friends.
